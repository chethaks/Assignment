# Assignment
Design to Development
1.	I have used fluid design and minimal media query to achieve responsiveness.
2.	Fonts are not web safe which is used in design. So, I have used Roboto to maintain consistency.
3.	Used simple JavaScript to reset bar status without reloading page.
4.	Colors picked from design and added some new colors to match or animate as required.

Thank you!
